## Abstract

In software development the testing framework is very important for the quality of the software artifacts. The testing framework is the site of tools improve the engineering effectivenes. In traditional sense, the software tasting food Reiten, a large scale called pace, because the software is complexity. So the testing logic has a large scale solution space for example, if we have 10 condition check branch, then the possible solution space is 2^10.

Sometimes we try to write a set of integration testing cases. In traditional way we need to write a lot of code to test the software. the code is freestyle, without structure and governance. So we need the framework to help us to write the testing code. 

This proposal describes some features about testing framework as follows:

1. Write the test case easily.
2. Make the test keys is human readable.

[A short summary of the proposal.]

## Background

[An introduction of the necessary background and the problem being solved by the proposed change.]

### Related Proposals: 
* A list of proposals this proposal builds on or supersedes.

## Proposal

[A precise statement of the proposed change.]

### Temporary environment variable protection

[Name the environment variable(s) used to enable/disable the feature(s) this proposal introduces and their default(s).  Generally, features that are enabled by I/O should include this type of control until they have passed some testing criteria, which should also be detailed here.  This section may be omitted if there are none.]

## Rationale

[A discussion of alternate approaches and the trade offs, advantages, and disadvantages of the specified approach.]


## Implementation

[A description of the steps in the implementation, who will do them, and when. If a particular language is going to get the implementation first, this section should list the proposed order.]

## Open issues (if applicable)

[A discussion of issues relating to this proposal for which the author does not know the solution. This section may be omitted if there are none.]
